As I write these words, my heart is overflowing with emotions that only you can inspire. From the moment you entered my life, you've filled it with a light and joy I never knew was possible.

Every day with you is an adventure, a blessing, and a gift I cherish deeply. Your smile brightens even my darkest days, and your love gives me strength I never knew I had.

You know me better than anyone - my dreams, my fears, my quirks and imperfections - and still, you choose to love me. That is the most precious gift I could ever receive.

As we've grown together, I've become more certain of one thing: I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to build a future where we face every triumph and challenge side by side.

I invite you to continue to the next page, where I've collected some of our most precious memories - a journey that has led me to this moment.`;
